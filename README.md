## Fourier series, a poem ...

The Fourier series is a branch of Fourier analysis that aims to decompose a periodic function into a sum of exponentials (or trigonometric functions) with different frequencies and magnitudes, in this particular demonstration, we are defining $f(t)$ to be a periodic complex function with $t\in[0, 1]$

$$
f(t) = \dots + c_{-2}e^{-2\cdot 2\pi it} + c_{-1}e^{-1\cdot 2\pi it} + c_{0}e^{0\cdot 2\pi it} + c_{1}e^{1\cdot 2\pi it} + c_{2}e^{2\cdot 2\pi it} + \dots
$$

Represent $f(t)$ as a sum of exponential functions rotating at frequencies of $0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...$ rotations per $t$

$$
\int_0^1 f(t) dt
$$

Taking the integral of the function across its domain

$$
\int_0^1 f(t) dt = \int_0^1 (\dots + c_{-1}e^{-1\cdot 2\pi it} + c_{0}e^{0\cdot 2\pi it} + c_{1}e^{1\cdot 2\pi it} + \dots)dt
$$

Expanding $f(t)$ in terms of its Fourier series

$$
\int_0^1 f(t) dt = \dots + \int_0^1c_{-1}e^{-1\cdot 2\pi it}dt + \int_0^1c_{0}e^{0\cdot 2\pi it}dt + \int_0^1c_{1}e^{1\cdot 2\pi it}dt + \dots
$$

- 🔭 I'm currently developing the repositories [IPN-CS](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/IPN-CS) and [UPIIT-AR](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/UPIIT-AR), to promote the computation that works at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional

- 🐧 All my repositories work on linux, specifically on a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/index.html) based distro, use the scripts to configure your environment

- 🎥 I'm in love with .NET, its speed to program on it and its speed to execute, C# is great but F# is ahead of it's time

- 🌱 I'm currently learning **PyTorch, LibTorch, Computer Vision, Mojo and [Digital Image Processing](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/DIP)**

- 📝 I regularly write articles about what I learn Maths, CS, AI and Psicology on [medium](https://medium.com/@jonas_lara)

- 🙋🏽‍♂️ I have a [YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/@Jonas-1ara) channel in **SPANISH** where I explain [algorithms](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/Rock-Lee) and more!

- ✍🏽 Every day I make an effort to understand mathematics


- 👀 **Take a look at my [portfolio](https://jonas-lara.github.io/Portfolio-AI/)** 💼
