- 🔭 I'm currently developing the repositories [IPN-CS](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/IPN-CS) and [UPIIT-AR](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/UPIIT-AR), to promote the computation that works at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional

- 🐧 All my repositories work on linux, specifically on a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/index.html) based distro, use the scripts to configure your environment
 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning **PyTorch, LibTorch, Computer Vision, Mojo and [Digital Image Processing](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/DIP)**



- 🙋🏽‍♂️ I have a [YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/@Jonas-1ara) channel in **SPANISH** where I explain [algorithms](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/Rock-Lee) and more!

- 📝 I regularly write articles about what I learn Maths, CS, AI and Psicology on [medium](https://medium.com/@jonas_lara)

- 🎥 I'm in love with .NET, its speed to program on it and its speed to execute, C# is great but F# is ahead of it's time

- ✍🏽 Every day I make an effort to understand mathematics

$$\sum_{k=1}^n c = nc$$
