- 🔭 I'm currently developing the repositories [IPN-CS](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/IPN-CS) and [UPIIT-AR](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/UPIIT-AR), to promote the computation that works at the National Polytechnic Institute 

- 🐧 All my repositories work on linux, specifically on a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/index.html) based distro, use the scripts to configure your environment

- 🎥 Behind the scenes in **my projects with C;** [Web Server](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/Web-Server), [Malloc](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/Malloc), [Compiler](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/Compiler), [Shell](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/IPN-CS/tree/master/16.-Llamadas-al-Sistema/ConstruyeUnShell) and [Neural Network](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/NN-C) 

- 🌱 I'm currently learning **Rust, PyTorch, LibTorch, Computer Vision, Unity AR and [Digital Image Processing](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/DIP)**

- 🙋🏽‍♂️ I have a [YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/@Jonas-1ara) channel in **Spanish** where I explain [algorithms](https://github.com/Jonas-Lara/Rock-Lee) and more!

- 📝 I regularly write articles about what I learn from AI and CS on [medium](https://medium.com/@jonas_lara)

- ✍🏽 Every day I make an effort to understand mathematics

$$\sum_{k=1}^n c = nc$$
